## Open Refine (Google Refine)

- Tim Ribaric (Brock University)
- @elibtronic and http://elibtronic.ca
- http://openrefine.org/
- Reasons to use Open Refine
  1. It's portable - it's Java; use via web browser
  1. Sorting - simpler than Excel; interactive and intuitive
  1. Editing cells in bulk - good for massaging metadata; doesn't replace leading zeros
  1. Facets - good for narrowing results e.g. text facet
  1. Filters - works hand in hand with facets
  1. Infinite undo and redo - there is text summary of the changes; can extract all the steps performed in JSON to use in another project
  1. Supports lots of input data types - Excel, CSV, JSON, XML, RDF as XML, and Google Data docs; and also directly from the clipboard
  1. Creates lots of output data types - including HTML table; can use "Custom tabular exporter"
  1. Data at a glance - provides better flyover then Excel; manipulates things in real time
  1. Two clicks to cluster and visualize - e.g. to facet and filter on a timestamp column
  1. GREL (Google Regular Expression Language) - e.g. extracting messy postal codes; you can stack filters transforms
  1. It's free

## Using Open Data to Rig the Game and Win Free Books 

- Warren Layton
- LibraryThing (LT) - self catalogue your personal books; pulls in metadata from 3rd party services; also have event and location data; have user-submitted reviews
- Ottawa Public Libraries - have BiblioCommons interface to get user reviews
- LT has Early Reviewers program (LTER) - randomized chance of success
- LT offers badges for helping - can be used to boost stats
- LT has an Add Event API 
- Open Data Ottawa has event data for libraries bibliottawalibrary.ca/en/events-feed e.g. biblioottawalibrary.ca/en/node/22950
- wrote script in Perl (XML::Simple) to automate
- created lookup table for each branch and their corresponding LT ID
- then created events URLs and visited each with curl automatically
- from here:
  - expand to more libraries - e.g. Edmonton PL has REST API for events
  - refactor code and move to LibXML
  - automation
  - learn a new language
- April 2015 ALA Coding for Librarians book


## Teaching Code

- Thomas Guignard 
- @timtomch or tom@timtom.ca
- need to realize what we can and cannot do e.g. home renovations
- we have spectrum of knowledge, between "no clue" and "expert"
- if have no clue, then vulnerable to people selling you on wrong solutions i.e. at the mercy of vendors
- therefore need to move away from the "no clue" zone, so can have discussions as equals
- there is hacker/coder ethic that obfuscates things for non-coders
- saying something is "easy" can come across as insulting to others
- Leah Bolden (@seejanedrill) - series of videos on how to do drywalling 
- move away from Old Boys Club of computing 
- Software Carpentry
  - @swcarpentry
  - software-carpentry.org
  - https://github.com/swcarpentry for all lesson content, etc.
  - not software engineering - aimed at learning to help fix little things 
  - hold two-day intensive workships - command line / bash; python; version control; databases; regex
  - traditionally have focused on researchers and grad students
  - now branching out to other groups e.g. libraries - still determining what topics are best suited for library-specific training
  - intentionally use non-experts for instruction and helpers
  - inclusive / diverse
  - there is librarian workshop after Access 2015
- important when learning a new language to have a project to work on or will lose what you learned

## Training for Library Specialized Services: The Case of OJS

- Gabriela Mircea
- McMaster Library
- presentation from OCUL workshop in May 2015
- McMaster in 2014 moved from Digital Commons to OJS and DSpace
- this move involved clear communication with stakeholders and training of users
- have 15 journals to support
- at end of migration identified need for in-person training in addition to the OJS documentation
- ended up asking for help at OCUL Publishing/Hosting Community (which partners with PKP)
- there were reps from 4 Ontario universities that collaborated to create the OJS workshop training
- held a two-day workshop at McMaster on May 13-14, 2015 with audience of admins, faculty, grad students
- future directions
  - OJS workshop for grad students (with certificate of attendance)
  - OJS workshop for librarians, journal managers, and editors
  - OLA Super Conference 2016 proposal for a 4-hour workshop


## Docker Compose

- John Fink
- @adr
- docker is different from traditional virtual machine technology - very small memory usage
- docker is sort of like a cross between Git and Virtual Machines
- Code4Lib Journal - article on "docker wordpress" - used single machine; the docker way would be to split up the application into multiple machines (e.g. web, nginx or apache, database)
- https://github.com/jbfink/docker-atom
 

## Getting Started with Maps (Using Google Fusion Tables and BatchGeo)

- Jonathan Younker, Brock University
- @jtyounker
- e.g. map Tim Hortons data from Niagara Region open data set
- Google Fusion Tables - can be added to Google Drive - then import CSV
- batchgeo.com - copy and paste data into web page and it maps it


## Discussion / hackfest groups

- Open Refine
- Makey makey devices, Arduinos, Beagle Bones
- Docker, Vagrant, Chef
- Mapping cheese producers in Canada
- LCSH to VRM scripting
