# C4LN 2015

## Virtualization Project at SCPL

- David Bott, SCPL
- Sirsi-Dynix 
- Horizon upgrade in 2006
  - aging hardware
  - end of life for Windows 2003
  - sub-optimal use of resources
- Goals
  - virtualize server environment
  - upgrade OS to Windows 2008 and 2012 
  - faster disaster recovery 
  - optimize resources
- purchased Dell PowerEdge VRTX
  - 4-blade chassis (5U)
  - integrated 25-bay SAN
  - redundant power supplies
- using VMWare Essentials Plus
  - vMotion - move servers without interruption during maintenance 
  - thin-provisioning 
- for guest OS used MS Windows Server 2012 R2 DataCenter 
  - bought through TechSoup Canada
  - can have unlimited VMs per blade
- added backup solutions
  - Dell DL-1000 - multiple snapshots
  - Server-to-NAS (2008)
- Total project $42K+taxes
  - included all project management, configuration and installation
- Dell was very good in scoping out the details and implementing the solution
- after things in place then did physical-to-virtual conversions for multiple servers
- still need to migrate 
  - domain controllers on Windows 2003
  - IVR server (Talking Tech) 
- all eggs in one basket - VRTX hardware failure takes down all servers; still have offline capabilities for CKO (PC Reliance); but also susceptible to other failures already (network switches, Internet, Hydro); Dell has 4-hour on-site response time
- discussion about documentation required and how big shops vs. small shops handle it
- discussion of blade servers
- compared VMWare vs. HyperV - similar pricing, but went with VMWare because more industry standard and mature; also VMWare had 5-year support package
- can't afford redundancy but spend on resiliancy - e.g. have 1 Internet connection, but have regular backups of important servers/data
- none of the cloud services have patron data - SCPL does the authentication using SIP server


## MarcEdit for Mac

- Whitni Watkins
- @_whitni
- community crowd-funded a Mac for Terry Reese so he could build MarcEdit in Mac
- preview build released last week
- great for making bulk edits of records in ILS - use regex
- Mac UI very similar to the PC version
- http://bit.ly/1HPKoSt for work in progress
  - http://marcedit.reeset.net/marcedit-mac-port-information
- MARCTools is done; now working on MARCEditor
- requires Mac OS X or greater
- required Mono (.NET) MDK before installation of MARCEdit 


## Investigating BIBFRAME

- Alison Hitchens
- model of bibliographic data using linked data framework
- designed to replace MARC
  - can be used to transform existing MARC
  - can be used for new bibliographic descriptions
- core classes are: creative work, instance, authority and annotation
- www.loc.gov/bibframe/docs/model.html
- annotation = resource that enhances our knowledge about particular item
- modes of investigation
  - read official docs, white papers, etc. at LOC (www.loc.gov/bibframe)
  - BIBFRAME discussion list
  - webinars (LC, ALCTS, etc.)
  - Zepheira practitioner training ($$$)
  - experiment with tools
    - bibframe.org/tools - e.g. Comparison tool shows MARC vs. BIBFRAME output for record
    - BIBFRAME Scribe from Zepheira (editor.bibframe.zepheira.com/static) - uses real-time calls to LOC linked data for the drop-down lists within the form
    - BIBCAT (http://bibcat.org/)
    - there are discrepencies in data output from tools - some data cleanup is required with the results
  - study vocabulary
    - bibfra.me vocabulary navigation tool
  - see what others are doing e.g. BIBFLOW (http://www.lib.ucdavis.edu/bibflow/)
- https://renegadebibframe.slack.com
- https://github.com/RenegadeBIBFRAME/Vocab_review_docs
- Some barriers to participation
  - do you know about data modelling?
  - do you know about ontologies, vocabs, schema?
  - do you know how systems use the data you create?
  - have you done bulk data clean-up or analysis?
  - do you know what others might do with library data?
  - do you understand linked data?
- discussion about support of BIBFRAME in ILSes at present and in future
- discussion about how quickly BIBFRAME is being adopted 


## Common Lisp for prototyping

- David Fiander
- doing a research project of tracking researchers' personal collections vs. campus library collections
- List is programming language - uses parantheses for content separation
- Lisp started as "list processing" but has other data structures
- Lisp very good at memory management
- Practical Common Lisp (http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book) - available in Springer book collection
- there is no native Lisp library for Z39.50 - but there is a C library (yaz/zoom.h)
- foreign function interfaces in Lisp - i.e. call the Zoom C functions 
- Emacs works well for programming Lisp (used SLIME https://github.com/slime/slime)
- dynamic environment in Lisp allows for interactive debugging of the C library
- restas is a framework for developing web applications in Lisp
- quine = a program that prints the source code of the program
- Lisp is compiled language 


## Where Is It? Linking items in the catalog to shelf locations

- Jeff Proehl from Canisius College, NY
- proehlj@canisius.edu 
- used project to teach himself new things
- Canisius uses Summon as the discovery layer
- had to add the Where Is It? button in the Innovative WebPAC not in Summon record
- used combination of HTML5/CSS3, SVG (to draw map), JS (jQuery), JSON and PHP
- why they used SVG?
  - each to maintain
  - uses familiar language
  - accessible
  - allows for RWD
  - open standard (included in HTML5)
  - works in modern browsers, including mobile browsers
- used CSS3 :target to style item referenced through inpage anchor 
  - e.g. url#roomname will open map with roomname selected
- used JS to handle interactive selection of map content e.g. change picture based on room selected
- all room data is stored in a JSON file - the room ID matches the SVG room ID
- future - give users different result if item unavailable; add book information incorporated into the floor plan (esp. helpful for people using mobile)
- can use https://inkscape.org/en/ for creating vector graphics


## LCSH to RVM 

- Warren Layton
- RVM = Répertoire de vedettes-matièr (from Universite Laval)
- LCSH = Library of Congress Subject Headings
- CSH = Canadian Subject Headings
- RVM is a French adaptation of LCSH and CSH 
- two services 
  - access to RVM authority data (online and/or FTP access)
  - translation service ($$$)
- Program or be Programmed, Douglas Rushkoff
- toolbox
  - yaz-marcdump
  - language of choice that can handle MARC
  - RVM (and understanding of licensing)
  - database (to store RVM)
- questions raised
  - what if multiple matches in RVM for a given heading?
  - generate file for records with unmatched headings?
  - character encoding?
- Warren required RVM subscription to get the vocabularies
- discussion regarding the copyright issues surrounding metadata and bibliographic records


## Mapping of cheese producers in Canada

- Sara Allain and Thomas Guignard
- downloaded data set from http://cheese-fromage.agr.gc.ca/, but listed businesses didn't have address
- used the Google Places API to lookup the business name and province to get the lat/lng
- limited the data to 200 artisinal cheese makers
- used Open Refine for data cleanup and exported using templating option to create GeoJSON
- used LeafletJS to map the data with the GeoJSON file
- sallain.github.io/can-cheese-map


## Debate 

- Be it resolved that libraries need to invest in more cloud based services
- In favour
  - expertise not in house and cost can be minimal
  - makes information available everywhere on all devices
  - using services that consumers already use (e.g. Google or Microsoft mail)
- Against
  - definition of 'cloud' = give up control of system in name of simplicity
  - have to go through multiple levels of vendor/IT to get stuff done
  - privacy laws (e.g. Patriot Act)
  - campus IT can stop library IT from having fun/experiment
  - need clear agreement and pricing on 'exit services' i.e. exporting data when leaving the service
